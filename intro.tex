\chapter{Introduction}

This dissertation addresses the problem of efficient traffic light detection using the sensor hint of a smartphones.

Smartphone usage is growing in past years.
This growth of smartphones and GPS using provides a great oppertunity on navigation.
There is a lots of work on navigation for the automatic car.
For the pedestrian navigation, there is very limited work.

For the automatic cars and pedestraian navigation, though we hava GPS data of smartphones, we need to know the environment.
Traffic light detection is a very crutial part for this navigation.
Traffic light detection only a part of the navigation, so it's important to have lower comutatational time for this.
Sensor hint of smartphone can improve the compuutational time and detect the traffic light efficiently.

Our system focus on the detection of traffic light as a part of the navigation for the visually impaired people.
The contribution of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item Our system uses the sensor hint to improve the computation time. We can improve 10x computational time.
\item We use heuristic filter to check the traffic bulb in a black box that improve the accuracy.
\item We experiment and implement our system in the real time.  

\end{itemize}

The reminder of this dissertation is structed as fllows.
Background of the inertial sensor of smartphones and the image processing for traffic light detection is provided in chapter \ref{c:background}.
Some previous and ongoing work related to our system is described in chapter .
We describe the overall operation of our system in chapter \ref{c:system} followed by the evaluation result in chapter .
